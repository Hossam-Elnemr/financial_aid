Why should I do the financial aid application?
- You can't submit your quizzes or view the assignments without purchasing the course or the financial aid,
therefore, you will not be able to to take the certificate at the end of the course.

    "I’m a student from Egypt and want to learn Data Science. I’ve no job of my
    own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course.
    I live only for my scholarship, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate.
    Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs.
    So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn.

    I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. 
    Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera.
    I also plan to grade assignments that are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity."

  Finally, submit your application.
  After you submit your application, it will take up to two weeks to review your application.
  You can see course materials for free while you are waiting for your application to be approved by using the "audit mode".
If your application is approved, you'll get an email letting you know, and you'll be automatically enrolled in the course. 
Courses have personalized deadlines, so you won't need to worry about falling behind. 

If you do not complete the course within 180 days, you may submit another application.
I hope that this was helpful.
Good luck!
